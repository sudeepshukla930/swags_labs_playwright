### ü§ñ Overview
This test automation framework is developed using Playwright to automate testing of the Sauce Labs site. It adopts the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to enhance code organization and maintenance, ensuring scalability and reusability of test scripts. The framework integrates HTML , logger and Allure reports to provide comprehensive insights into test execution results, facilitating effective debugging and analysis.It also have nyc code coverage
